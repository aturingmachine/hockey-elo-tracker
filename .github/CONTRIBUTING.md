# Contributing Guidelines

### Issues

- Documentation: Updating the docs
- UI/UX: Related to designs and User Experience
- Hardware: Related to the hardware part of the application

### Pull Requests
A Pull request should be made from a branch named `ELO-<issue number>`. This should directly correlate to the issue that you are attempting to resolve. 

Respond to review comments and change requests in a semi-professional manner (i.e. Don't get defensive, we're here to build something cool. Comments are most likely in good faith).

#### Opening A PR
When opening a PR please do the following:
- Assign yourself, this helps tracking on the board.
- Assign all other devs as reviewers. You only need one *B O O P* but more eyes never hurts.
- Tag it to the `Elo Tracker` project. **THIS IS IMPORTANT**.
- Follow the PR Template!

#### Merging
Your PR got merged, Congrats! Now you need to do some project stuff. After a PR is merged ensure:
- Your branch was deleted upon merge, lets keep a tidy house.
- The PR card on the project board is in the `Done` section (this should happen automatically).
- Close the original issue that your PR is for, this should automatically move it to the `Done` section.
- Celebrate!
